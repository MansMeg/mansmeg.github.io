#### Bio

I am currently an assistant professor in Statistics at [Department of Statistics, Uppsala University](https://www.statistik.uu.se/?languageId=1). Before Uppsala University, I was a postdoc under [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) at the [Department of Computer Science at Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), Finland. I hold a PhD from Linköping University, Sweden, supervised by [Mattias Villani](https://www.mattiasvillani.com/) and with [Marco Kuhlmann](https://www.ida.liu.se/~marku61/) as co-supervisor. During my PhD, I was a guest researcher/PhD at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) under [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/).

In 2019, I was awarded the Cramér prize for the best dissertation in Statistics and Mathematical Statistics in Sweden for my thesis [Scalable and Efficient Probabilistic Topic Model Inference for Textual Data](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1201965&dswid=-8297). 

I hold two research grants from the [Swedish Research council](https://www.vr.se/english.html) (see projects) and has been awarded the [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/) postdoctoral researcher grant. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) at Linköping University.

I have a background as a statistician for [the Swedish Agency for Education](https://www.skolverket.se/), [the Swedish Agency for Crime Prevention](https://www.bra.se/), and [the Swedish Agency for Public Health](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/) where I was working on education statistics, crime statistics and, public health.

#### Research Interests
My research interest is in Bayesian Statistics and Probabilistic Machine Learning and how we can use these tools to draw scientific conclusions about society and culture. I have a particular interest in using text as data for scientific inference.

#### Research Interests Keywords
