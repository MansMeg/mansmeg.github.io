#### Short Bio
I am an assistant professor of Statistics at Uppsala University, Sweden and affiliated with the Institute for Analytical Sociology at Linköping University, Sweden. My primary research interests are Bayesian inference, probabilistic machine learning, and statistical inference from textual data. 

#### Extended Bio
I am currently an assistant professor in Statistics at [the Department of Statistics, Uppsala University](https://www.statistik.uu.se/?languageId=1) in Sweden and affiliated with the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) at Linköping University, Sweden. During 2024 I am part of the Uppsala University [AI4Research](https://www.uu.se/en/research/ai4research) sabathical project.

Before my position at Uppsala University, I was a postdoc under [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) at the [Department of Computer Science, Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), Finland and I hold a PhD from Linköping University, Sweden, supervised by [Mattias Villani](https://www.mattiasvillani.com/) and with [Marco Kuhlmann](https://www.ida.liu.se/~marku61/) as co-supervisor. During my PhD, I was a guest researcher/PhD at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) under [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/).

My research interests focus on Bayesian statistics and probabilistic machine learning, especially model evaluation, diagnostics and inference algorithms. In addition, my research interests also encompass statistical inference for textual data. This work includes using transformer-based neural networks for scientific inference and researching probabilistic latent semantic models, such as word embeddings and topic models. The work on text-as-data also addresses issues of efficiently curating large corpora for research purposes.

In 2023, my collaborators and I were awarded the price [Statistician of the Year](https://statistikframjandet.se/statistikframjandet/botten-ada-blir-arets-statistikframjare-2022/) for the work with [Botten Ada](https://www.bottenada.se/), a [Bayesian model for election prediction](https://youtu.be/Dtk5ghFmhz8) of the Swedish election. In 2019, I was also awarded the Cramér Prize for the best dissertation in Statistics and Mathematical Statistics in Sweden for my thesis [Scalable and Efficient Probabilistic Topic Model Inference for Textual Data](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1201965&dswid=-8297).

I was elected to be part of the [Swedish Young Academy](https://www.sverigesungaakademi.se/en-GB/1.html) in May 2023 for a period of five years.

I hold two applied research grants from [the Swedish Research Council](https://www.vr.se/english.html) (see the projects Mining for Meaning and Welfare state analytics). I also have a grant from [Länsförsäkringars forskningsfond](https://www.lansforsakringar.se/stockholm/privat/om-oss/hallbarhet--forskning/forskning/om-forskingsfonden/) (see the project LFStats), and a starting grant from [the Swedish Research council](https://www.vr.se/english.html) (see the project GenProb). Further, I'm also part of the [SWERIK](https://swerik-project.github.io/) research infrastructure project financed by [Riksbankens jubileumsfond](https://www.rj.se/) (see project for details). Previously I was awarded the [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/) postdoctoral researcher grant. I am also involved in projects with legal scholars at Cambridge University in the area of Law and AI.

I have a background as a statistician for [the Swedish Agency for Education](https://www.skolverket.se/), [the Swedish Agency for Crime Prevention](https://www.bra.se/), and [the Swedish Agency for Public Health](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/) where I was working on education statistics, crime statistics and, public health.

In addition to my scientific work, I have a deep interest in local journalism and was a funder of the journalistic startup [Newsworthy](https://www.newsworthy.se/) that is producing data-driven local journalism in Sweden and is behind [Botten Ada](https://www.bottenada.se/).
