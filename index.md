#### Bio

I am currently an assistant professor in Statistics at [the Department of Statistics, Uppsala University](https://www.statistik.uu.se/?languageId=1) in Sweden. My research interest focus on Bayesian statistics and probabilistic machine learning, especially model evaluation, model diagnostics and inference algorithms. In addition, my research interests also encompass statistical inference for textual data. This work includes both using transformer-based neural networks for scientific inference and research on probabilistic latent semantic models, such as word embeddings and topic models. The work on text-as-data also addresses issues of efficiently curating large corpora for research purposes using active learning.

Before my position at Uppsala University, I was a postdoc under [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) at the [Department of Computer Science, Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), Finland. I hold a PhD from Linköping University, Sweden, supervised by [Mattias Villani](https://www.mattiasvillani.com/) and with [Marco Kuhlmann](https://www.ida.liu.se/~marku61/) as co-supervisor. During my PhD, I was a guest researcher/PhD at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) under [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/).

In 2019, I was awarded the Cramér prize for the best dissertation in Statistics and Mathematical Statistics in Sweden for my thesis [Scalable and Efficient Probabilistic Topic Model Inference for Textual Data](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1201965&dswid=-8297). 

I hold two applied research grants from [the Swedish Research council](https://www.vr.se/english.html), one grant from [Länsförsäkringars forskningsfond](https://www.lansforsakringar.se/stockholm/privat/om-oss/hallbarhet--forskning/forskning/om-forskingsfonden/), and one research infrastructure project financed by [Riksbankens jubileumsfond](https://www.rj.se/) (see projects for details). Previously I have been awarded the [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/) postdoctoral researcher grant and [the Swedish Research council](https://www.vr.se/english.html) starting grant for young researchers in data science. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) at Linköping University, Sweden.

I have a background as a statistician for [the Swedish Agency for Education](https://www.skolverket.se/), [the Swedish Agency for Crime Prevention](https://www.bra.se/), and [the Swedish Agency for Public Health](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/) where I was working on education statistics, crime statistics and, public health.
