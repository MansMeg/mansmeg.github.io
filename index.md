#### Short Bio
I am an associate professor in Statistics at Uppsala University. My primary research interests are Bayesian inference, probabilistic machine learning, and statistical inference from textual data. 

#### Extended Bio
I am currently an associate professor in Statistics at [the Department of Statistics, Uppsala University](https://www.statistik.uu.se/?languageId=1) and affiliated with the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) at Linköping University and the [Institute for Future Studies](https://www.iffs.se/en/), all in Sweden. 

My research interests focus on Bayesian statistics and probabilistic machine learning, especially model evaluation, diagnostics and inference algorithms. My research interests also encompass statistical inference from textual data, with applications in sociology, political science and law. This work includes using transformer-based neural networks for scientific inference and researching probabilistic latent semantic models, such as (probabilistic) word embeddings and topic models. The work on text-as-data also addresses issues of efficiently curating large data.

I hold a PhD from Linköping University, Sweden, supervised by [Mattias Villani](https://www.mattiasvillani.com/) and with [Marco Kuhlmann](https://www.ida.liu.se/~marku61/) as co-supervisor. The thesis, [Scalable and Efficient Probabilistic Topic Model Inference for Textual Data](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1201965&dswid=-8297), was awarded the [Cramér Prize](https://statistikframjandet.se/cramersallskapet/cramerpriset/) for the best dissertation in Statistics and Mathematical Statistics in Sweden 2018. During my PhD, I was a guest researcher/PhD at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) under [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/). Between 2018 and 2020, I was a postdoc under [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) at the [Department of Computer Science, Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), Finland. 

I currently hold a starting grant from [the Swedish Research council (SRC)](https://www.vr.se/english.html) in data science on "Improving Probabilistic Programming generalizability". In addition, I'm also a co-PI of the [SWERIK](https://swerik-project.github.io/) research infrastructure project financed by [Riksbankens jubileumsfond](https://www.rj.se/) on the improving Swedish parliamentary proceedings for large-scale textual research.

In 2023, my collaborators and I were awarded the price [Statistician of the Year](https://statistikframjandet.se/statistikframjandet/botten-ada-blir-arets-statistikframjare-2022/) for the work with [Botten Ada](https://www.bottenada.se/), a [Bayesian model for election prediction](https://youtu.be/Dtk5ghFmhz8) of the Swedish election. During the same year, I was elected to be a member of the [Swedish Young Academy](https://www.sverigesungaakademi.se/en-GB/1.html) in May 2023 for a period of five years and in 2024, I was elected a member of [ the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu/).

Previously, I was project member of the two larger SRC grants [Mining for Meaning](https://liu.se/en/research/computational-text-analysis) and [Welfare State Analytics](https://www.westac.se/en/), both doing large scale text analysis in sociology and history. During 2024, I was also elected to the Uppsala University [AI4Research](https://www.uu.se/en/research/ai4research) sabathical grant on using AI in research applications.

I have a background as a statistician for [the Swedish Agency for Education](https://www.skolverket.se/), [the Swedish Agency for Crime Prevention](https://www.bra.se/), and [the Swedish Agency for Public Health](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/) where I was working on education statistics, crime statistics and, public health.

In addition to my scientific work, I have a deep interest in local journalism and was a funder of the journalistic startup [Newsworthy](https://www.newsworthy.se/) that is producing data-driven local journalism in Sweden and is behind [Botten Ada](https://www.bottenada.se/).
