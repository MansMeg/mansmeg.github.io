#### Bio


I'm currently an assistant professor in Statistics at [Department of Statistics, Uppsala University](https://www.statistik.uu.se/?languageId=1). Before Uppsala, I was a postdoc under [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) at the [Department of Computer Science at Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), Finland. I hold a Ph.D. from Linköping University, Sweden, supervised by [Mattias Villani](https://www.mattiasvillani.com/). In 2019 I was awarded the Cramér prize for the best dissertation in Statistics and Mathematical Statistics in Sweden for my thesis [Scalable and Efficient Probabilistic Topic Model Inference for Textual Data](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1201965&dswid=-8297). I hold two research grants from the [Swedish Research council](https://www.vr.se/english.html) and was recently awarded the [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/) postdoctoral researcher grant.
