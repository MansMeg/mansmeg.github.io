#### Bio

I am currently an assistant professor in Statistics at [Department of Statistics, Uppsala University](https://www.statistik.uu.se/?languageId=1) in Sweden. My research focuses on two different areas. My first area of interest is Bayesian statistics and probabilistic machine learning, especially model diagnostics and inference algorithms. My second area of interest is how we can use textual data for statistical inference, especially in the scientific domain. This work includes research in probabilistic latent semantic models, such as word embeddings and topic models, but also recent neural networks with transformer architectures. I am also working on how to curate large corpora for research purposes efficiently using active learning and transformer models.

Before Uppsala University, I was a postdoc under [Aki Vehtari](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/) at the [Department of Computer Science at Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science), Finland. I hold a PhD from Linköping University, Sweden, supervised by [Mattias Villani](https://www.mattiasvillani.com/) and with [Marco Kuhlmann](https://www.ida.liu.se/~marku61/) as co-supervisor. During my PhD, I was a guest researcher/PhD at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) under [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/).

In 2019, I was awarded the Cramér prize for the best dissertation in Statistics and Mathematical Statistics in Sweden for my thesis [Scalable and Efficient Probabilistic Topic Model Inference for Textual Data](http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1201965&dswid=-8297). 

I hold two research grants from the [Swedish Research council](https://www.vr.se/english.html) (see projects) and has been awarded the [Academy of Finland](https://www.aka.fi/) postdoctoral researcher grant. I am also affiliated with the [Institute for Analytical Sociology](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias) at Linköping University.

I have a background as a statistician for [the Swedish Agency for Education](https://www.skolverket.se/), [the Swedish Agency for Crime Prevention](https://www.bra.se/), and [the Swedish Agency for Public Health](https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/) where I was working on education statistics, crime statistics and, public health.
