title: Transformer-based language models and active learning for finite-population estimation from textual data, with applications in crime statistics
---




#### Abstract
In recent years, new large-scale language models (LLM) have been developed that are based on deep neural networks with transformer architectures (Vaswani et al, 2017). These models has been shown to be very effective and set a new standard for text classification (see e.g. Devlin et al., 2018, and Liu et al., 2019). 

These new LLMs opens up new possibilities for finite-population estimation from large textual data, i.e. a large part of the descriptive statistics produced in public agencies, research, and industry. This project aims to develop and use Swedish language models together with active learning for effective production of statistics from textual data.

This project will focus in two areas, (1) development of language models for use in the area of finite-population estimation and (2) analysis and estimation of error sources for population estimators. The project will focus on official crime statistics, and possible the use in the insurance industry. 

If the project is successful, it will enable more efficient production of statistics from large textual material. The projects will also, hopefully, enable new official criminal statistics (regional and national) that cannot be produced with conventional methods.

The project is partly financed by [Länsförsäkringars forskningsfond](https://www.lansforsakringar.se/stockholm/privat/om-oss/hallbarhet--forskning/forskning/om-forskingsfonden/) and is conduced in close collaboration with [the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention](https://bra.se/bra-in-english/home.html) (Brå).
